		<h1 class="name">An Introduction to Homestuck</h1>
		<p class="name"><cite class="important">Homestuck</cite> is a webcomic run by Andrew Hussie. <cite>Homestuck</cite>, which is part of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com" class="link">MS Paint Adventures</a>, is about four thirteen-year-old children who play a video game called <i>Sburb</i>, and then enter a realm called the Medium. The game is as old as time itself, and the object of the game is to create a new universe. Once each universe has reached maturity, the dominant species of that universe will then proceed to play the game and start their own session. This continues until a session is considered to be "null", or unbeatable. If a session is null, then a "scratch", or reset, may be implemented in order to restart the universe from the beginning and try to create a valid session. So far in the story, two species have played the game: humans and trolls.</p>
